=============================
The vkd3d 3D Graphics Library
=============================

Vkd3d is a 3D graphics library built on top of Vulkan. It has an API very
similar, but not identical, to Direct3D 12.

==============
Building vkd3d
==============

Vkd3d depends on SPIRV-Headers and Vulkan-Headers (>= 1.1.101).

Vkd3d generates some of its headers from IDL files. If you are using the
release tarballs, then these headers are pre-generated and are included. If
you are building from git, then they will be generated at build-time using
widl. By default, vkd3d will use the widl found in `PATH'. If widl is not
available or is not recent (>= 3.20), then you can build Wine with `make
tools/widl' to avoid building all of Wine. You can then point vkd3d's
configure at that widl binary with `WIDL="/path/to/widl"'.

===========
Using vkd3d
===========

Vkd3d can be used by projects that target Direct3D 12 as a drop-in replacement
at build-time with some modest source modifications.

If vkd3d is available when building Wine, then Wine will use it to support
Direct3D 12 applications.
