/* Hack for MinGW-w64 headers.
 *
 * We want to use WIDL C inline wrappers because some methods
 * in D3D12 interfaces return aggregate objects. Unfortunately,
 * WIDL C inline wrappers are broken when used with MinGW-w64
 * headers because FORCEINLINE expands to extern inline
 * which leads to the "multiple storage classes in declaration
 * specifiers" compiler error.
